      <p>
        Play Wii Bowling in a group of four people,

      <h2>How does this work?</h2>
      <p>
        This is an asynchronous tournament that you can participate in any time the red Wii is available before the end of the tournament.<br>
        Participating is simple! All you have to do is:
        <ol>
          <li>Assemble a team of four CA's!</li>
          <li>Play a standard game of bowling in Wii Sports Resort!</li>
          <li>Take a picture of the score screen when the game is over!</li>
          <li>Submit the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf7ZhQjc0QqdFmaIqBlRFaq1Fzxf7PzfzqNWW5HXsu99aP59Q/viewform?usp=header" target="_blank">online form</a>! It requires a file upload, so you'll have to be logged into Google for it to work.
        </ol>

      <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All participants must be a CA (current or veteran).</li>
        <li>You need a full team of four people, and each person needs to participate! One person can't play as multiple users in a single game. If someone has to leave early, it's okay to sub in someone else. You'll just need to figure out whose name to put in the entry form.</li>
        <li>The photo you upload in the form needs to contain the scores of all four participants directly from the game. I can't verify the game without them!</li>
        <li>Only bowling games in Wii Sports Resort count towards the tournament (not Wii Sports).</li>
        <li>Teams are allowed to submit entries for multiple games! But if there is a team that hasn't played yet and wants a turn, be sure to give them a chance to play :)</li>
        <li>One person can't play for more than one team. Or two teams. I don't know. This is kind of a loose rule. Just don't submit as a member of too many teams!</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Are there prizes?</h2>
      <p>
        I made some badges that took me a whole thirty minutes to design, so you'll definitely be getting those!

      <h2>What happens in the event of a tie?</h2>
      <p>
        Honestly, I don't know! Maybe I'll flip a coin and pick a winner at random? If some members of the tie-breaking teams are around by the end of the week to do an extra game, maybe they can do an "overtime" game? I'll figure it out later... probably.
