      <p>
        Play Wii Bowling in a group of four people,
        <br />but don't compete against each other.
        <br />Compete against the world!

      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is an asynchronous tournament. Your team consists of the players in your Wii Sports Resort standard bowling game, and your team's entry is basically the sum of all of your scores. The team with the highest total score wins!<br>
        This is just something I&nbsp;(Charlie Tuttle) set up for fellow CAs thinking it'd be a fun idea. This is not an official GDC or CA program event.

      <h2>How does one participate?</h2>
      <p>
        Participating is simple! All you have to do is:
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Assemble a team of four CAs!</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Play a standard game of bowling in Wii Sports Resort!</strong> Solo mode is fine.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Take a picture of the score screen when the game is over!</strong> Make sure you don't accidentally click past this screen without taking the picture.<br>

      <h2>When does it end?</h2>
      <p>
        I'll announce the winners at 5:00 PM on Friday, March 13, 2026!

      <h2>What are the rules?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>All participants must be a CA (current or veteran).</li>
        <li>You need a full team of four people, and each person needs to participate! One person can't play as multiple users in a single game. If someone has to leave early, it's okay to sub in someone else. You'll just need to figure out whose name to put in the entry form.</li>
        <li>The photo you upload in the form needs to contain the scores of all four participants directly from the game. I can't verify the game without them!</li>
        <li>Only bowling games in Wii Sports Resort count towards the tournament (not Wii Sports).</li>
        <li>Teams are allowed to submit entries for multiple games! But if there is a team that hasn't played yet and wants a turn, be sure to give them a chance to play :)</li>
        <li>One person can't play for more than one team. Or two teams. I don't know. This is kind of a loose rule. Just don't submit as a member of too many teams!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Are there prizes?</h2>
      <p>
        The winning team will get:
        <ul>
          <li>Cool badges that took me a whole hour to design!</li>
          <li>Plushes from a popular indie game!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>What happens in the event of a tie?</h2>
      <p>
        Honestly, I don't know! Maybe I'll flip a coin and pick a winner at random? If some members of the tie-breaking teams are around by the end of the week to do an extra game, maybe they can do an "overtime" game? Sadly, I only have enough prizes for one winning team.<br>
        I'll figure it out later... probably.

      <h2>Can the game still qualify without the scores pic?</h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, without a picture of the score screen, I can't verify your game, and, therefore, I won't be able to count it towards the tournament. Wii Sports Resort doesn't give you a way to go back to the score screen once you click past it, so the best thing you can do is play another game. Maybe you'll get an even better score!
